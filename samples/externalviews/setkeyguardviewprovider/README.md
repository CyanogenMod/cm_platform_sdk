# Notice
This sample is provided as a way to set and clear the setting that defines what
KeyguardExternalViewProviderService the system should use. Changing this setting
requires a permission that is only granted to system apps.  As such, this sample
is not intended to be built as a standalone application and must be built as part
of the CyanogenMod build system.
