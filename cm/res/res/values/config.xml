    <!-- Whether to enable app suggest overlay which allows app suggest
         provider to be replaced by an app at run-time. When disabled, only
         the config_appSuggestProviderPackageName will be searched for app
         suggest provider, otherwise packages whos signature matches the
         signature of config_appSuggestProviderPackageNames will be searched,
         and the service with the highest version number will be picked.
         Anyone who wants to disable the overlay mechanism can set it to false.

         Note: There appears to be an issue with false if we reinstall the provider which causes
         it to not get the update and fail to reconnect on package update.  It's safer to just
         use the list version with config_appSuggestProviderPackageNames.
